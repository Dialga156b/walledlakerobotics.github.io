<title>Why are you here? No seriously, this page is literally pointless. There is no reason for this page to be here. Are you poking around in the inspect element thingy? Why? Do you want to look at our code? Its literally written by random high schoolers, its not going to be any good lmao. Forks and spoons and knives don't go in the microwave. Seriously. Don't do that. The last time I did that I inadvertnedly blew up a microwave. It was not good. It was electricity and stuff everywhere and everyone got scared and then I got grounded :(. Btw did you know that this website is hosted on a linux server (probably).This site is not hosted on a linux server. Eat my dick.</title>
