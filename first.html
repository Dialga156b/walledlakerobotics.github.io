                by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology
                skills,
                that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence,
                communication, and leadership. FIRST was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and
                participation
                in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, not-for-profit public charity designs

                in
                science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.
