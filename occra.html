              They provide a robotics challenge every year to warm teams up for the First season. 
              <id style="font-style: italic;">OCCRA</id> creates a game for the teams similar to First but less complicated.  
              To compete in these games, students are tasked to build a robot capable of playing the given game to the best of their ability. 
              Students work as a team using their knowledge of mechanical and electrical engineering, CAD design and programming with the help of their mentors, to build and control their robots to achieve the given goal.
               Each year <id style="font-style: italic;">OCCRA</id> gives a new objective for teams, like FIRST, to compete in so each year students can learn practical knowledge of mechanics, engineering, programming and physics every year in a new, fun way.
